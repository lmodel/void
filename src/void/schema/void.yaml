  The Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets (VoID) is an RDF Schema vocabulary for expressing metadata about RDF datasets. It is intended as a bridge between the publishers and users of RDF data, with applications ranging from data discovery to cataloging and archiving of datasets. This document provides a formal definition of the new RDF classes and properties introduced for VoID. It is a companion to the main specification document for VoID, Describing Linked Datasets with the VoID Vocabulary (http://www.w3.org/TR/void/).
